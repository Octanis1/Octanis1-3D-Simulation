A.R.T.O.S. - Autonomous Robot Toolset for Orientation Simulation

Setup:
Start an instance of the program an host a simulation session. Once this is done, start another instance and connect to the host. There will be an automatic distribution of the Mission Control (Host) and Robot (Client) roles.

Default Functions:
Use WASD to control the robot unit.

Mission Control (Host):
Controls robot and accesses specific functions of the robot via RPCs. The functions are given by the morphology of the robot, i.e. the modules it has. These modules are defined by Mission Control and transmitted to the simulation environment during the initialization phase of the program.

Robot Instance (Client):
The simulation environment will generate a robot and provide a rich set of external stimuli to the sensors of its modules. After a given time interval (as defined by Mission Control) the robot will then send back a global update of all its sensors for Mission Control to process.
